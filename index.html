I was working in a small <strong>agile team</strong> where I was involved in the whole development life cycle, <strong>from design to maintenance</strong>, including of course development, but also testing, deployment and monitoring. We were doing systematic code reviews and pair programming on a regular basis and I <strong>supervised and mentored newcomers</strong>. My missions involved working in conjunction with after-sales service, editorial and marketing teams to best meet the needs of the clients and customers. I also had the opportunity to take more responsibility by being the <strong>technical referent</strong> of one of the project.</p><ul class=resume-list><li>PHP, Ruby, Symfony, Architecture, Automated Testing</li><li>MySQL, Elasticsearch, RabbitMq, Docker</li></ul></div></div><div class="item mb-3"><div class="item-heading row align-items-center mb-2"><h4 class="item-title col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 mb-2 mb-md-0">Software Engineer (3 months Internship)</h4><div class="item-meta col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 text-muted text-left text-md-right">Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University (Scotland) | 2016</div></div><div class=item-content><p>As an intern my mission was to develop (from scratch) a prototype Android and Android wear app as part of a project that intended to develop a support system for people living with low back pain. The application collected data from sensors present on a smartwatch, sending it on a mobile phone where the data was analysed in order to predict the activity done by the user, and then the result was displayed. The most important part was to implement the activity recognition system developed by a research fellow. I worked alone and independently, however, as I was creating a prototype for other people to use, I made sure to have a clean and well documented code.</p><ul class=resume-list><li>Java Android, for mobile phone and smartwatch</li><li>Librairies: OpenCV and MPAndroidChart</li></ul></div></div><div class="item mb-3"><div class="item-heading row align-items-center mb-2"><h4 class="item-title col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 mb-2 mb-md-0">Volunteering in farms in the UK</h4><div class="item-meta col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 text-muted text-left text-md-right">WWOOF | 2014</div></div><div class=item-content><p>I traveled during 6 months in the UK helping with daily tasks in farms or gardens, and living alongside my hosts. I did a lot of gardening, but I also was lucky enough to help in a farm during lambing time. I learned to work under pressure, sometimes alone, and to take quick decisions. More generally this time out of my comfort zone has allowed me to discover a new culture and new ways of thinking.</p><ul class=resume-list></ul></div></div><div class="item mb-3"><div class="item-heading row align-items-center mb-2"><h4 class="item-title col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 mb-2 mb-md-0">Various short-term jobs</h4><div class="item-meta col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 text-muted text-left text-md-right">Decitre, Lizeo,... | 2012 - 2015</div></div><div class=item-content><p>I used to work as a librarian and a data-entry operator. These jobs taught me to work rigorously, within deadlines and according to instructions.
